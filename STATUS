This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.14.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.14.1:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1876410
   Fix the .editorconfig stanza for Makefile's.
   Justification:
     Make $EDITOR do the right thing on any backport branches we may create
     off this stabilization branch.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, stsp

 * r1878413
   autogen.sh: Remove per SWIG bindings checked files on release mode.
   Justification:
     The release tarballs should not contain .swig_*_checked files
   Votes:
     +1: futatuki, rhuijben

 * r1878909, r1878918, r1878950
   Fix a number of thinkos in human-readable file size formatting.
   Justification:
     Fixes wrong output and an assertion failure in debug mode.
   Votes:
     +1: brane, rhuijben

 * r1879198
   Fix an invalid quoting in working copy upgrade system that only works
   because SQLite automatically fixed this. More recent SQLite functions
   will signal an error when deprecated features are disabled.
   Justification:
     Causes user-visible errors.
   Note:
     This filechange by itself doesn't trigger a change that make will
     handle. So make sure you recompile the sql queries for testing.

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1877960
   * INSTALL (I.C.12): Add Note that non-release mode is required for building
     SWIG Python 2 bindings.
   Justification:
     We've not entirely dropped Python 2 bindings support on 1.14.x yet
