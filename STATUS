   Do not suggest --help -v for commands which do not support -v.

 * r1882326
   Fix issue #4762 "authz doesn't combine global and repository rules"
   Justification:
     Restore behaviour of SVN 1.9: It is now again possible to override
     per-path access rules for specific users (and groups) at the global
     level. Such global rules are overridden by repository-specific rules
     only if both the user and the path match the repository-specific rule.
